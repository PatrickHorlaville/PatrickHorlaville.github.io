Master's Thesis Project @ Bishop's University
======
* For my Master's thesis project, I am developing a novel method to identify supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) host candidate galaxies from archival spectroscopic surveys
* In essence, I am using novel insights drawn from cosmological simulations that suggest that galaxies harbouring supermassive black hole binary systems have unique stellar kinematic features
* The approach of my project is to look through galaxy surveys for which kinematic information is available (which are called Integral Field Unit or IFU surveys), and to search among the available galaxies the unique stellar kinematic features that are suggestive of the presence of a SMBHB system
* In addition to those stellar kinematic features, I also use galaxy surface brightness profile information to aid in selecting the SMBHB host candidate galaxies
* Supervisor: John J. Ruan

Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) @ Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA)
======
* For my research internship at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA) during the Summer of 2022, I revitalized a line intensity mapping program and implemented a novel model for the parametrization of the cosmological [C II] signal. This work notably allowed me to publish a [first-author paper](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/531/3/2958/7687167)
* Supervisors: Dongwoo Chung, Dick Bond
