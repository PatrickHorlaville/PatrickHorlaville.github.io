(currently under construction, come back soon!) 

I am Patrick, presently a Master's student in Physics at Bishop's University in the Multi-Messenger Astrophysics Research group under the supervision of [Prof. John Ruan](https://gamma-research.space/). I am a junior astronomy researcher broadly interested in cosmology and supermassive black holes, notably in the unique relationship they share with their host galaxies and the mechanisms that can bring them to merge with each other. 

I am actively looking for an astronomy PhD position starting Fall 2025! If my profile sparks your interest and you would like to know more about me, [drop me an email](mailto:patrick.horlaville@gmail.com)!


Research Activities
======
For my Master's thesis, I am developing a project whose objective is to develop a novel method to identify candidate host galaxies of closely separated (less than 100 parsec or so) dual AGNs. Later, it would be exciting to go further and use a high-resolution space telescope to observe those candidate galaxies and try to confirm the presence of their dual AGNs! It's a thrilling perspective, as we have yet to detect dual AGNs this close to each other. This would be an important step towards empirically establishing the chain of events that lead gravitationally unbound supermassive black holes to form hardened gravitationally bound binary supermassive black holes! 

Prior to my Master's degree, I completed my undergraduate studies in honours physics (BSc.) at McGill University, where I wrote my honours thesis in the cosmology group of [Prof. Matt Dobbs](https://sites.google.com/a/mcgillcosmology.ca/mcgillcosmology/matt-dobbs). While a student at McGill, I participated to various research projects, including at the [Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics](https://www.cita.utoronto.ca/) in Toronto as a [Summer Undegraduate Research Fellow](https://www.cita.utoronto.ca/opportunities/surf-at-cita/) under the supervision of [Dr. Dongwoo Chung](https://dongwooc.com/) and [Prof. Dick Bond](https://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~bond/).

Other Interests

I nurture multiple interests outside of academia and research. If you're interested, I encourage you to have a look at my [Other Interests](https://patrickhorlaville.github.io/markdown/) page!
