Welcome to my website! (currently under construction, come back soon!) 

I am Patrick, presently a Master's student in Physics at Bishop's University in the Multi-Messenger Astrophysics Research group under the supervision of [Dr. John Ruan](https://gamma-research.space/). I am a junior astronomy researcher broadly interested in cosmology and supermassive black holes, notably in the unique relationship they share with their host galaxies and the mechanisms that can bring them to merge with each other. 

I am actively looking for a PhD position in astrophysics starting Fall 2025! Please contact me by email if you are looking for PhD students and you would like to know more about me.


Research Activities
======
For my Master's thesis, I am developing a project whose objective is to develop a novel method to identify candidate host galaxies of closely separated ($\lesssim$ 100 parsec) dual AGNs. If this proves promising, it would be exciting to go further and a use high-resolution space telescopes to actually detect those dual AGNs! This would be quite the hoot, as we have yet to detect dual AGNs this close to each other, despite how important they are in our understanding of how, if ever, do supermassive black holes merge with each other!
